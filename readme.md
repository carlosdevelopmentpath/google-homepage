My first Odin Project. 
Have to make a basic copy of the google homepage, using knowledged acquired until now. 
Have happily completed freeCodeCamp, responsive web design certification.
Not too difficult, had some issues with centering the main element (images and search bar), but generally happy
Cannot figure our how the google site on mobile resizes, mine does, but does it differently, oh well!
